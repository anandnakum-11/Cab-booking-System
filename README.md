# Cab-booking-System
A Cab Booking System project that simulates the process of booking cabs for users. It allows customers to register, choose cab types, book rides, view fare calculations, and manage bookings. This project demonstrates the use of data structures, classes, and file handling to create a console-based cab management application.
